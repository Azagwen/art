# Commissions

This directory contains all of our commissioned art. It's organised by artist, 
with additional credit and licensing information contained within each separate
folder.

As all the works in this directory (and its subdirectories) were created via
commissions, **they are not licensed under the main repository license**.
Instead, all commissioned artwork belongs to the artist/s that were responsible 
for creating it. We'll have negotiated specific terms with each artist
for our own uses - **these terms are negotiated between the artist/s and The Quilt
Project** and, unless otherwise specified, do not give anyone else any rights to 
use the works of art.

The licensing terms will be explained within the corresponding `README.md` file
in the artist's folder. Additionally, different works of art may have different
licensing terms - we'll make sure to explain everything as clearly as possible.
