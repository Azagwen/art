# Lil' Pineapple: Minecraft Version

![Lil' Pineapple Emoji](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuiltMC/art/master/emoji/lil-pineapple/lil-pineapple.png)

This emoji was created by [@yanasakanadev](https://twitter.com/yanasakanadev), a modder, pixel artist and 3D-modeler. They created the model JSON and texture file, and we created the emote and turntable GIFs.

They managed to knock this emoji together in about 5 minutes. If you like it, please feel free to [check out their Twitter](https://twitter.com/yanasakanadev)!
